[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The Kicad Calculator gives you the Chance to calculate the most important Things without leaving Kicad.

The Calculator consists the following Options:

* Regulators
* Track Width
* Electrical Spacing
* Trans Line
* RF Attenuators
* Color Code
* Board Classes

== Calculators

[[regulators]]
=== Regulators

This calculator helps with the task of finding the values of the resistors
needed for linear and low-dropout voltage regulators.

For the _Standard Type_, the output voltage V_out

as a function of the reference voltage V_ref

and resistors

R_1 and R_2 is given by:

For the _3 terminal type_, there is a correction factor due to the quiescent current I_adj flowing from the adjust pin:

This current is typically below 100 muA and can be neglected with caution.

To use this calculator, enter the parameters of the regulator _Type_,V_ref and, 

if needed, I_adj ,select the field you want to calculate 

(one of the resistors or the output voltage) and enter the other two values.

[[track-width]]
=== Track-Width

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Track Width calculator calculates the trace width for printed circuit board conductors for a given current. 
It uses formulas from IPC-2221 (formerly IPC-D-275).

[[electrical-spacing]]
=== Electrical-Spacing

In the Picture you can see that you can edit the Voltage and the Calculator gives you the correct Values.

The minimal Values which orientatd at the IPC-2221 too.

[[transline]]
=== TransLine

Transmission line theory is a cornerstone in the teaching of RF and microwave engineering.

With the RF Attenuator you can calculate different things by choosing:

* PI
* Tee

[[color-code]]
=== Color-Code

This calculator helps translating the color bars from the resistor to its value. To use it, first select the _tolerance_ of the resistor: 10%, 5% or smaller than 2%. For example:

* Yellow Violet Red Gold: 4 7 x100 ±5% = 4700 Ω, 5% tolerance
* 1kΩ, 1% tolerance: Brown Black Black Brown Brown
